Data Storing Application

Git clone this repository to a designated location on your device and run the vs file within.

Once you try to open a form it will give a missing resource error.

 To fix this go to "Manage Nuget Packages" after right clicking on your solution, then you will be able to see some sort of message in yellow on the top. 
 Click that button that is presented there and install the metro mordern ui package that appears on your left side of the screen after the button is clicked.
 
 Finally go to your workspace and from solution explorer right click your solution again and click "Rebuild".
 
 That should do the trick and you can start on your work.
