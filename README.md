# Data-Storing-Application-Setup
This is the Setup.exe file of the Automated Data Storing Application

In the current day Metal Crushers, selling and providing various metals for road 
constructions, building constructions and so on, manual data entry is widely used. 
A main concern in that field is the displaying of entered data in a database and the 
finished Excel or Access File. But after some information gathering, we found out 
that data entering analysts have a hard time entering data and displaying them in 
another which is inefficient and time costly. Due to the hardship users face while 
entering we thought of creating an environment which is user friendly and is 
professional. So, to speed up the process and to provide the users with a userfriendly environment that does both displaying and creating a final monthly file we 
came up with the idea of creating an automated data storing system.
